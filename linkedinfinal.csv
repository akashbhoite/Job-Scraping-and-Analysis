Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we’re pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.Our ValuesWe believe we can help build a future for everyone.We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society’s challenges like those who live them every day.Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.The OpportunityOur mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century.

In partnership with Santa Clara County Social Services Agency, Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE), we seek an experienced data scientist to develop a predictive analytics model that helps keep families together. The agency’s mission is to provide resources and opportunities in a culturally responsive manner to enhance the quality of life, with ORE serving as the evidence generating and disseminating function. The fellow will lead a process to integrate datasets and create statistical models that identify families at high-risk for child welfare involvement and poor outcomes such as homelessness, using findings to recommend strategies that amplify impact.About this Role: The fellow will utilize strong problem-solving skills and expertise in analyzing, modeling, and interpreting data to understand and better address the needs of children and families. While the Office of Research and Evaluation has built impressive evidence generating and sharing mechanisms, there is an increased need to generate future-facing models that help the agency know where to invest resources.
